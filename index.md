## Sid Pillai's first CS193 Lab!
#
#The last time I did anything related to coding was in the 10th grade, 5 years ago so theres not much I remember. While most people in these classes seem to have a decent amount of expeirience, being brand new to the  field comes with some difficulties. Some of the things I like about CS193 are :
#
#1. The TAs assume everyone has no knowledge of the topic and give very detailed instructions so that anyone can complete the instructions.
#2. The curriculeum is created to be useful in our Computer Science careers and does not require a crazy amount of studying or memorisation.
#3. The TAs are approachable and answer questions and queiries no matter how dumb the questions are.
